SPACE\n\n\tA sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of \n\tthe planet, OGANA. Five small moons slowly drift into \n\tview from the far side of the planet. The main \n\ttitles are followed by a roll-up:\n\n\t\tUntil the recent GREAT REBELLION, \n\t\tthe DAI NOGAS were the most feared \n\t\twarriors in the universe. For one \n\t\thundred thousand years, generations \n\t\tof DAI perfected their art as the \n",
  "\t\tpersonal bodyguards of the King. \n\t\tThey were the chief architects of \n\t\tthe invincible ROYAL SPACE FORCE, \n\t\twhich expanded the King�s power \n\t\tacross the galaxy, from the celes-\n\t\ttial equator to the farthest stars.\n\n\t\tNow these legendary warriors are all \n\t\tbut extinct. One by one, they have \n\t\tbeen hunted down and destroyed as \n\t\tenemies of the NEW GALACTIC KINGDOM \n\t\tby a ferocious and sinister rival \n\t\twarrior sect, THE LEGIONS OF LETTOW.\n\n\tA small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of \n\tthe ",
  "Ogana moons.  The deadly little fightercraft \n\tspeeds past several of the moons, until it finally \n\tgoes into orbit around the FOURTH MOON.\n\n2.   VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES- FOURTH MOON - OGANA\n\n\tA harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of \n\tthe Fourth Moon.  The blood red sky presses down on a \n\tlone figure, JUSTIN VALOR, a tall, heavy-set boy of \n\tsixteen.   He slowly makes his way across a wierd \n\tplain covered with huge sprawling lakes.  The water in \n\tsome of the lakes is bright red, while in othe",
  "rs it is \n\ta vivid green.  The oddly colored lakes create an \n\tominous landscape against the eerie red sky.\n\n\tThe heavy winds whip at the young boy and make the \n\tgoing extremely difficult.  His face is covered by a \n\tbreath mask and goggles.  He stops for a second to \n\tadjust the shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelazer \n\trifle.  Something in the sky catches his eye, and he\n\tinstinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from \n\this belt.  He stands transfixed for a few moments, \n\tstudying the heavens, t",

SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - OGANA\n\n\tA damaged spacecraft, half buried in the dust, rests \n\tnext to the remains of an abandoned supply shack.  Justin\n\tmakes his way across the colorless landscape and \n\trushes into the crumbling building.  The interior of \n\tthe hut is shabby, but manages to abate the howling \n\twinds.  Seated in front of a thermoheater are Justin's\n\tfather, AKIRA, and his young brother, BINK.  Akira is \n\ta large, burly man, ",
  "wearing the distinctive robes of a \n\tDai.  Bink is ten years old, with dusty blond hair and \n\ta large scratch on his cheek.  Justin slams the door \n\tand removes his gear.   His ruggedly handsome face is \n\tcaked with many layers of dust.\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tDad!  Dad!  They've found us!\n\n\tBink looks up from a small cube he has been studying. \n\tHis father whacks him across the shoulder with a \n\tbraided wire connector.\n\n\t\t\t\t AKIRA\n\t\tContinue with the problem.  Your \n\t\tconcentration is worse than your \n\t\tbrother's. ",
  " (to Justin)  How many?\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tOnly one this time.  A Cao Four.\n\n\t\t\t\t AKIRA\n\t\tGood.  We may not have to repair \n\t\tthis old bucket after all.

This is the correct answer.  Justin is\n\tstrapping on a utility belt with chrome lazerpistols \n\tand lazersword.  Akira rises and starts for his equip-\n\tment.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK (Cont.)\n\t\tAhhh, Pop...\n\n\t",

Get your gear.\n\n\tBink jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to \n\ta ten-year old and grabs his gear.  His father frowns \n\tand shakes his head.\n\n4.

He's baiting us. \n\t\tI'm surprised they only sent one this \n\t\ttime.  We must be wearing them down, \n\t\tor they must think this warrior is \n\t\tsomething special.  Stay on guard, \n\t\tand keep hidden.  I'm going to work \n\t\tmy way across the ridge and call his \n\t\tbluff.  Better we meet in open combat \n\t\t",
  "than wait for him to ambush us.  Keep \n\t\tyour guard!\n\n\tAkira leaves his two sons and moves off along the \n\tobscured ridge.  Justin and Bink watch him intently. \n\tJustin throws down his multiplelazer rifle in dis-\n\tgust.\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tHe should have let me go with him.  \n\t\tHe's getting too old to make an open \n\t\tchallenge.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tHe's not too old to realize you'd \n\t\tjust get in the way.\n\n\tJustin ignores his little brother's remark and sneaks \n\ta look over the ridge at the Lettow spacecraft.  Akira \n\tm",
  "oves out of the rocks some distance away and starts \n\ttoward the starship.  Bink moves to the ridge next to \n\this brother, his chrome lazerrifle sparkling in the \n\treflected red light of Ogana.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tHe's making his move.\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tWatch your guard... and cover \n\t\tthat weapon.  It shines like a \n\t\tbeacon.\n\n\tBink reluctantly move away and watches the other \n\tdirection.  Akira has almost reached the Lettow \n\tspacecraft and still there is no sign of its \n\toccupant.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tWhat's happening?\n\n\t",
  "\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tNothing.  I don't like it.\n\n\tAkira carefully moves to the main hatch of the star-\n\tship.  He kicks a valve and the hatch drops open \n\twith a loud clank and rushing gas.  Justin becomes \n\tmore tense as his father carefully moves inside the\n\tspacecraft.  Everything is still.  Even the continual \n\twinds seem to have died down.  Moments pass with no \n\tsign of activity inside the enemy starship.  Justin \n\twatches the craft with his electrobinoculars.  The \n\twaiting becomes unbearable.\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t",
  "\tSomething's happened!  He's been in \n\t\tthere too long.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tLet me look!  Stand my guard.\n\n\tBink takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and \n\tstudies the silent spacecraft.  Justin impatiently \n\tscans the distant red horizon.\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tI think the power just went off. \n\t\tWe'd better wait here until some-\n\t\tone comes out.\n\n\t\t\t\t JUSTIN\n\t\tWhat if he needs help?\n\n\t\t\t\t BINK\n\t\tThe power went back on again....\n\n\tWith the aid of the electrobinoculars, Bink watches \n\tthe running lights of the stars",
  "hip flash on and off.\n\tSuddenly something huge moves in front of his field \n\tof vision.  Before either of the two young boys can \n\treact, a large, sinister Lettow warrior in black \n\trobes and a face mask  looms over them.  He carries \n\ta long lazersword which cuts young Bink down before \n\the or his brother is able to raise his weapon.  The \n\tstartled Justin backs away in horror, then settles \n\tdown and ignites his lazersword which creates an \n\teerie red glow.  He stumbles over rocks as he attempts \n\tto avoi",

The evil \n\twarrior swings his mighty lazersword, but Justin \n\tmanages to deflect the intended deathblow.\n\n\tFinally, Justin is able to assume a defensive stance, \n\tand the two warriors stand, sizing up each other.  The \n\tlegionnaire is at least seven feet tall, and dwarfs \n\tthe young Dai.  They stand for a few moments, almost \n\tfrozen, then in a flurry of blows, lazerswords clash \n\twith the sound of electric snapping and popping. \n\tJustin is barely able to hold his own against",
  " the \n\texperienced warrior.  Many blows are exchanged before \n\tthe Lettow warrior is able to back Justin up against \n\ta deep crevasse.  Justin stumbles and almost falls \n\tover the cliff to his death.\n\n\tThe legionnaire suddenly senses something behind him \n\tand whirls around to face Justin's father, Akira Valor, \n\ta Dai Nogas master.  The Lettow warrior raises his \n\tlazersword, but is cut in two before he can bring it \n\tdown again.  Akira moves to the fallen legionnaire \n\tand studies him carefully.  Justin, ",
  "still a little \n\twobbly from the whole experience, attempts to stand. \n\tAkira sees his dead son Bink and goes to him.  He \n\tlifts him into his arms and begins to weep.  Justin \n\tstands bewildered, watching his father cradle the \n\tdead child.\n\n5.   INTERIOR LETTOW STARSHIP - VALLEY OF COLORED LAKES - \n\tOGANA\n\n\tAkira Valor slides into one of the four seats of the\n\tsmall Lettow starship.  Through the front viewing \n\tcanopy, he watches Justin drag Bink's body to a small\n\tcrevasse.  Justin places a small locket ",
  "around his \n\tbrother's neck, makes a complicated sign, and dumps \n\tthe body into the shallow depression.  The giant \n\tengines of the spacecraft begin to whine, kicking up \n\tlarge clouds of dust.\n\n\tJustin climbs into the seat beside his father and \n\tremoves his breath mask and goggles.   There are \n\ttears in his eyes.  Father and son look out across \n\tthe wasteland towards Bink's grave.  The thunderous \n\tclap of an explosion is followed by a small mushroom \n\tcloud rising out of the depression.  Justin throws",

When will it \n\t\tstop?\n\n\tJustin's father waits silently until the tirade is\n\tfinished.

He is a thin gray \n\tlooking man with an evil mustache hanging limply \n\tover his insidious lip.  Standing at rigid attention \n\ton his right are several generals  dressed in the \n\tblack and grey uniform of the realm.  Five mem",
