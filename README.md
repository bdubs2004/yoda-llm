# yoda-llm

This is supposed to be a collection of the code I have used to try and make a LLM (phi-2 model) specialize in star wars.  As well, have the speech patterns of yoda.  I have used an encyclopedia of the star wars universe as well as all of the screen writes for all the star wars movies as data for the LLM to be based off of.  I then created a RAG system off of the vector storage I created so the LLm could reference the information and give detailed answers based off of the data it found.
